Well, I got the markdown working. I think? This is definitely a more... minimalistic approach than I've used before, but it's a lot easier to write I suppose. For the record, I did end up using [thephpleague's Commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark) -- however, it required Composer and for some reason my server didn't have enough memory to configure fucking composer (apparently Pleroma is a fine, but a PHP dependency manager? nooooo), so I ended up having to set it up in a VM and then copy it over to my server. Fun.

Anyway, for now (possibly forever), old style HTML posts are now contained in the archive. However, I did convert the last post just because.

Anyway, I'll probably end up revamping the layout again to go along with this. I currently just have titles as `<h2>` and date/time as `<h3>`, so I'll also need to figure out a way to configure permalinks and metadata as well. This would be useful for setting up a proper Atom/RSS feed which I previously "tried" to do -- sorry drunk me, your idea was good but your implementation was shite.

Anyway, that's all for now. Til next time.
