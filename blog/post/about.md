If you don't already know, the name's Reagan; I'm 20, from Canada, and I'm a Linux enthusiast with an interest in web design/development.

There's quite a few posts here that pertain to the development of this site, but honestly? Most of the stuff here is just my personal thoughts, often negative in nature. That being said, this is my personal blog on my personal site on my personal webserver so... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Anyway, feel free to take a look if you'd like. Reader beware, I accept no liabilities for boredom, mental distress, leg cramps, computer explosions, burning your dinner, transcending to an alternate dimension, ending up on a watchlist, or death caused by viewing anything on this website.
