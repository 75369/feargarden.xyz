# Blog revamp

It probably doesn't look like it, but I *did* end up redoing the blog. I decided to not do a complete redesign bc I didn't feel like it, but I did end up rewriting the CSS (which is now more compact) and cleaning/restructuring the site directories.

Instead of dealing with old posts, I just decided to take them off the and instead throw them in a [repo on my Gitea](https://git.feargarden.xyz/reactor/snippets/src/branch/master/blog-archive). I was originally gonna write a script that would de-HTMLify and de-PHPify them to make them a bit more human-readable, but I decided it wasn't really worth the effort as I doubt anyone really cares. If anything, it now gives insight into how shitty my old posting style was and I why I decided to switch to straight markdown.

**Current to-do:**

* ~~Implement markdown parser~~
* Setup XMPP server
* ~~Setup gitea instance?~~
* ~~Blog layout redesign~~
* ~~Migrate mail server~~

Hmmm. I need to think of some new things to do.

**In an alternate universe...**

Kinda fuckt up to think that had all this Covid shit not happened, I would be in Toronto enjoying [Miku Expo 2020](https://mikuexpo.com/usaca2020/) rn. Sadly, it's been delayed to late September. :< ig it's something I can now enjoy for my birthday, though?

I'm disappointed, but this is life, so ig I'll settle for watching older videos of Miku Expo instead.

**In the games department**

On the bright side, even if Miku Expo was delayed, Mega 39's for the Switch is apparently releasing... on the 15th?? I just found out about this within the past week or two and holy shit, I didn't even know they'd announced the release date -- much less with such a close release. Anyway, that's pretty sick; there's even [a demo available on the eShop which is nice](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hatsune-miku-project-diva-mega-mix-switch/). I'm also assuming a mainline Project Diva game on the Switch means Sega is no longer bound to Sony exclusivity, which mayhaps will mean we'll *finally* get a PC port. 

In addition to Mega 39's, Mangagamer is also finally releasing the eighth and final chapter of Higurashi today, 5 years after they initially published the first chapter, Onikakushi. I actually finally got around to finishing Ciconia, so this is welcome as something new to read.

Anyway, that's all for now.

Til next time.
