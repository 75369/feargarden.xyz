If you're somehow not familiar with Higurashi, it's a very well-known murder mystery VN from the early-mid 2000s, spanning 8 chapters total (plus some extras/spinoffs). It takes place in a remote Japanese village in 1983, and centers around a group friends and their connection to the village's curse where every year two victims are "demoned away" -- one is murdered, and the other simply disappears.

Honestly I'm not very good at summaries and explaining things, but Higurashi is one of my favourite series and I definitely reccomend giving it a read (especially since it's currently free!). I will provide a disclaimer that chapter 1 does start off slow as it introduces the setting and characters, but later chapters do pick up the pace quicker once everything has been established and introduced.

**Alternatively, the anime**

If for whatever reason you're not really into reading, Higurashi does also have a great anime from the mid-2000s and while it does look dated, it's still a fun watch and highly reccomended. iirc it doesn't really get into the l o r e as much as the VN does (which provides walls of text on the history of Hinamizawa), but it's still a pretty faithful adaptation imo. 

The watching order is this btw:

* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni
* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai
* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei (spinoffs; the first and last eps are silly while the middle eps are pretty good)
* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kira (spinoffs; just silly episodes with no real relevance to the plot)
* Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku -Outbreak- (spinoff; I don't really like this one)

They also recently announced that they're gonna be doing a new anime which should be debuting this summer, so it'll be interesting to see how that turns out. I think it's a remake?

I've been planning on making a Higurashi/WTC page on my Neocities, and I feel like this would be a good time to do so. :thinking:

Til next time.
