Spoiler alert: it's me! :D

My mum's bf -- with no prior notice or discussion -- just made the sudden demand for me to pay him x amount by tomorrow, or I have to leave. So ig I'm leaving.

My mother dearest apparently didn't know about this decision judging by her reactions, but it's not like she bothered to defend me in any way. I guess I shouldn't have expected anything else.

I'm trying to think of this in a positive light (that I will *finally* be leaving this godawful household), but I can't help but feel epic sad over the whole thing. There's nothing quite like being told by your "f a m i l y" that you're welcome to stay in a homeless shelter if you can't pay up, and just otherwise implying that they give 0 fucks about you.

Whatever.
 
Luckily I somehow managed to arrange to stay with my guitarist's grandmother, who I was originally supposed to be moving in with anyway. However, this arrangement isn't as nice as me moving in proper; I'll just be staying in her basement on an air mattress bc that's the best we can do for now. It's not great, but it's not like I have any other options. We're literally in the midst of a global fucking pandemic.

Til next time.
