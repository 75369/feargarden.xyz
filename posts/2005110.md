# Gitea and future thoughts

Well, I can cross another thing off my to-do list now: I managed to get Gitea setup, so that's pretty poggers. It was actually pretty easy to configure which was nice, though I did have some issues with SSL -- the configuration states that when using a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) and Let's Encrypt there are some specific settings that should be used within Gitea (ie. `ENABLE_LETSENCRYPT=true`), but those seemed to cause issues and it worked fine without them. Maybe I'm just fucking braindead and misinterpreted the docs, but idk. It werks (for now).

Anyway, [git.feargarden.xyz](https://git.feargarden.xyz/reactor) is my instance. The dark/green theme inspired to make the assets [Koshka](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGcmWJ7WoAEM9F5?format=png&name=large)-themed, so I ended up making this to use as the favicon:

I'm no master of pixel art, but I think it ended up looking good enough for something that is displayed at 16x16 and I like it. :3c

**New to-do list**

With this out of the way, ig I should revise the to-do list. It now looks like this:

* ~~Implement markdown parser~~
* Setup XMPP server
* ~~Setup gitea instance?~~
* Blog layout redesign
* Migrate mail server

**Mail server**

Probably the biggest priority atm is the mail server. A few weeks ago I actually moved my fg.xyz files to a different server, and in doing that I revoked and removed the old certs for the site. However, I completely forgot that I used those certs for the mail server, so it, uh... doesn't work anymore. 

I suppose technically I could just generate new certs (idk if I would be able to due to how Let's Encrypt works tho), but instead I'm just gonna take this as a sign that I should migrate the mail to the new location. This is actually something I've been meaning to do for an eternity, but I keep putting it off bc mail servers are a fucking bitch to setup.

The primary use for my mail server has really just been for SMTP (for Nextcloud, Pleroma, Gitea, etc.) so I've considered honestly just using an external service such as Mailgun, but ultimately I would prefer to host it myself so I have complete control over it. That being said, it's only been used to send mail from my services -> me (at least I hope to god no one has emailed my @feargarden.xyz addresses bc idk how long it's been down lol) so it's not like it's a major problem but... ehhhh.

Anyway, that's all I've got to say for now. I'm pretty bad at finding ways to conclude posts.

Til next time.
