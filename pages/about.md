# about me

The name's Reagan. I'm 20, an unironic nightcore listener, and a cryptid with a computer. I hail from the sewers of Ontario, Canada.

This is my website where I post a lot of bullshit. I'm some dumbass hobbyist with no formal education, but a passion for technology regardless. I've been a home Linux user since about 2013-ish, and have been running servers as well since 2018. I tend to mess around with HTML/CSS and PHP a lot, but I don't really do anything that's particularly amazing and revolutionary. In addition to working on this site, I'm also fairly active on Neocites (... I say as I have not updated my site in months, oops). 

My main interests include Linux and other related things that involve me sitting at my PC and avoiding human contact.

I also play some video games; I'm a fan of The Elder Scrolls (mostly Online rn), Half-Life, Doom, Project Diva, and When They Cry. I also play whatever else happens to catch my eye (mostly FPS games), but I'm no hardcore enthusiast by any means.

Honestly, I tend to write more about myself and my interests on my [Neocities](https://reagnyan.moe). Checking out my [social media](/contact.html) is also a good way to see what kind of bullshit I'm on.
