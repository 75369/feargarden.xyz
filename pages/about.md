**Long version**

The name's Reagan. I'm 20, an unironic nightcore listener, and a cryptid with a computer. I hail from the sewers of Central Ontario, Canada.

This is my website where I post a lot of bullshit. I'm some dumbass hobbyist with no formal education, but a passion for technology regardless. I've been a home Linux user since about 2013-ish, and have been running servers as well since 2018. I tend to mess around with HTML/CSS and PHP a lot, but I don't really do anything that's particularly amazing and revolutionary. In addition to working on this site, I'm also fairly active on Neocites. 

My main interests include Linux and other related things that involve me sitting at my PC and avoiding human contact.

I also play some video games; I'm a fan of The Elder Scrolls (mostly Online rn), Half-Life, Doom, Project Diva, and When They Cry. I also play whatever else happens to catch my eye, but I'm no hardcore enthusiast by any means.
