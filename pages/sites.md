![Post from @mewmew@blob.cat "@reag how many sites do you have holy- every time I look at your sites it seems like another one comes out of hiding"](/images/mewmew.png)

I have a number of other sites/services/whatever that I run.

## &#10014; [git.feargarden.xyz](https://git.feargarden.xyz) 

My [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us) instance. [@reactor](https://git.feargarden.xyz/reactor) is my main acccount.

## &#10014; [scenecore.net](https://scenecore.net)

My [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social) instance. [@reag](https://scenecore.net/reag) is my main account. 

## &#10014; [systematic.love](https://systematic.love)

Formerly my [Misskey](https://join.misskey.page) instance and also my [XMPP](https://xmpp.org) server (specifically running [Prosody](https://prosody.im)). In the past, I've also used it to test [Matrix/Synapse](https://matrix.org) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org). Idk what I'm doing with this now.

My [Neocities](https://neocities.org) website, just under a funky domain name. I definitely reccomend giving Neocities a try if you're interested in a free static web host that's trying to bring back the days of Geocities, by the way.
