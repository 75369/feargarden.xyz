I have a number of other sites/services/whatever that I run.

<a href="https://youtu.be/kapVAVWgUOk"><i class="fa fa-music" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Current [Matrix/Synapse](https://matrix.org) instance. *Mostly* functional and kind of just in testing for now; it doesn't support some features like presence due to resource constraints.

## [systematic.love](https://systematic.love)

<a href="https://youtu.be/gWiA9o6fv4U"><i class="fa fa-music" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Currently my [XMPP](https://xmpp.org) server, specifically running [Prosody](https://prosody.im). Formerly my [Misskey](https://join.misskey.page) instance. In the past, I've also used it to test Synapse and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org).

## [reagnyan.moe](https://reagnyan.moe)

My [Neocities](https://neocities.org) website, just under a funky domain name. I definitely reccomend giving Neocities a try if you're interested in a free static web host that's trying to bring back the days of Geocities, by the way.
