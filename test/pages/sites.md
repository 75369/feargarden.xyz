# My websites

I have a number of sites that I run.

* [feargarden.xyz](https://feargarden.xyz)

This website.

* [git.feargarden.xyz](https://git.feargarden.xyz)

My Gitea instance. I also have [Github](https://github.com/75369), but it's mostly just for saving and following things.

* [scenecore.net](https://scenecore.net)

My Pleroma instance. [@reag](https://scenecore.net/reag) is my main account. 

* [systematic.love](https://systematic.love)

My Misskey instance and secondary fedi server. [@reactor](https://systematic.love/@reactor) is my main account here. 

* [reagnyan.moe](https://reagnyan.moe)

My [Neocities](https://neocities.org) website, just under a funky domain name. I definitely reccomend giving Neocities a try if you're interested in a free static web host that's trying to bring back the days of Geocities, by the way.
