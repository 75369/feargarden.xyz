				<p><img src="//img.feargarden.xyz/site/about/shannon.gif" style="float:right;"></p>
				<p>The name's Reagan. I'm 20, an unironic nightcore listener, and a cryptid with a computer. I hail from the sewers of Central Ontario, Canada.</p>
				<p>This is my website where I post a lot of bullshit. I tend to mess around with HTML/CSS and PHP a lot, but I don't really do anything that's particularly amazing and revolutionary. In addition to working on this site, I'm also fairly active on Neocites.</p>
				<p>My main interests include Linux and other related things that involve me sitting at my PC and avoiding human contact.</p>
				<p>I also play some video games; I'm a fan of The Elder Scrolls (mostly Online rn), Half-Life, Project Diva, and When They Cry. I also play whatever else happens to catch my eye, but I'm no hardcore enthusiast by any means.</p>
